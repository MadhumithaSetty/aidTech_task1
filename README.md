Create a Password Generator

Steps to create the project:

1. Define the length of the password: Decide on the length of the password that you want to generate.

2. Define the character set: Decide on the character set you want to use to generate the password. This can include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

3. Create a function to generate the password: Write a function that takes in the length of the password and the character set as parameters and generates a random password.

4. Use random number generation: Use Java's built-in random number generator to generate random characters from the chosen character set.

5. Convert the password to a string: Convert the generated password to a string and return it from the function.

6. Add user input: Add functionality to allow the user to input the desired length of the password and the character set to be used.

7. Test the program: Test the program by generating passwords of different lengths and using different character sets.
